# Anthbot
Personal Twitch bot that I'm making just for fun. I might make it user friendly if I have the time

The idea just came from my hours spent on twitch, I wanted to make my own bot, and after some researches I found some python tutorials on how to create an IRC bot, so yeah at this time the code might look a lot like most bots you can find.

The spambot.py is a modified version of Anthbot.py that I made while watching a stream, I wanted to try how many spambot programs could send a message on the same channel at the same time.
